# AI Final Project

## Algorithm
- Using __Minimax alpha-beta pruning__ and add the __effection of depth__

## Feature
- 3 game Modes (human-human, human-ai, ai-ai)
- each game mode can choose play turn
- 5 difficulty (if in human-ai, this process provides ai-learning mode, which mean the ai would modify the difficulty depand on the previous game rounds)
- using multiprocessing

## How to execute
- Run the main.py file

## TODO
- [x] person vs person
- [x] person vs ai
- [x] ai vs ai
- [x] ai with specific level in ai vs ai mode
- [x] ai with learning in person vs ai mode
- [x] BIF multiprocessing by pool method(at branch: master)
- [x] ray module multiprocessing (at branch: ray-parallel)
